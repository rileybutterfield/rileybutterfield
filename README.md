###What I'm working on:
Right now, I'm a software engineering teaching fellow at Fullstack Academy - I help developers-in-training deepen their technical skills, gain confidence, and build amazing projects. In my spare time, I'm working on a mobile app, Popcorn, that helps indecisive movie lovers pick a flick (quick). I'm also dabbling in Python, Java, and Typescript.
